      <h2>Current Research</h2>
      <p>
        I work on tidal disruption events (TDEs) as transformative
probes of unique black hole (BH) populations, early stellar systems,
and galaxy structures.

          <strong>Rates of Stellar Tidal Disruption Events around Intermediate-mass Black Holes </strong> – Rates of stellar TDEs around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have been extensively calculated using the loss cone theory, while theoretical work on TDE rates around intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) has been lacking. In this work, we calculate the IMBH TDE rates based on their black hole masses and the stellar profiles of their host galaxies obtained from the latest observations.

          <strong>Detecting Population III Stars through Tidal Disruption Events in the Era of JWST and Roman</strong> – We propose a novel method for detecting Pop III stars through their tidal disruption events (TDEs) by massive black holes. We model the emission properties and calculate the expected rates for these unique TDEs in the early Universe at z ∼ 10.
