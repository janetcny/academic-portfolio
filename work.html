      <h2>Current Research</h2>
      <p>
        I work on tidal disruption events (TDEs) as transformative
probes of unique black hole (BH) populations, early stellar systems,
and galaxy structures. Through innovative theoretical modeling
and data analysis, we make fundamental advances that greatly improve
our understanding of these extreme astrophysical phenomena.
      </p>
      <p>
        TDEs are unique sensitive to intermediatemass
black holes (IMBHs). Our calculations reveal that IMBH TDE rates
are comparable to supermassive black hole (SMBH) TDE rates, with
higher likelihood of extreme penetration events. Furthermore, we identify
an inverse relationship between TDE rate and BH mass in the IMBH
regime, opposite to the classical trend seen for SMBHs, suggesting that
galactic environments hosting IMBHs may differ systematically from
those with SMBHs. By incorporating realistic galactic profiles, we establish
TDEs as a promising method for detecting these elusive IMBHs,
crucial for understanding SMBH seeding and growth across cosmic time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I assisted in developing the first framework for modeling TDEs of
Population-III stars, the first generation of stars formed in the universe.
Our models predict distinctive observational signatures featuring enhanced
mass fallback rates and prolonged infrared emission. These results
demonstrate the feasibility of identifying primordial stellar disruptions
with JamesWebb Space Telescope and the Roman Space Telescope,
creating unprecedented opportunities to study the universe’s first stars
and their connection to early BH formation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also investigated the intriguing properties of TDE host galaxy
environments. Our analysis reveals systems with enhanced central stellar
concentration yet no signatures related to galaxy mergers, which challenges
the common belief that TDE hosts tend to be post merger galaxies.
This finding, coupled with our novel findings of an enhanced bar
fraction in typical TDE hosts, strongly suggests secular evolutionary processes
may play a more significant role in creating TDE-favorable nuclear
environments than previously recognized.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, these advances elevate TDEs from rare astrophysical
curiosities to precision instruments for mapping the IMBH population,
detecting the first stars, and constraining galaxy evolution mechanisms.

      <h2>Past Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Rates of Stellar Tidal Disruption Events around Intermediate-mass Black Holes </strong> – Rates of stellar TDEs around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have been extensively calculated using the loss cone theory, while theoretical work on TDE rates around intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) has been lacking. In this work, we calculate the IMBH TDE rates based on their black hole masses and the stellar profiles of their host galaxies obtained from the latest observations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Detecting Population III Stars through Tidal Disruption Events in the Era of JWST and Roman</strong> – We propose a novel method for detecting Pop III stars through their tidal disruption events (TDEs) by massive black holes. We model the emission properties and calculate the expected rates for these unique TDEs in the early Universe at z ∼ 10.
